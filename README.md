# Advent of code 2020

Welcome to my advent of code 2020 contribution! The solutions are written in C# using .NET 5. When writing the solutions code I primarily aim for readability but try to always keep performance considerations in mind. Happy reading!

## Running the solutions
For running the code you need the [.NET 5.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) installed. Run the code via 
```
dotnet run
```

You can also have a look at my repl at [https://repl.it/@thejan14/adventofcode2020](https://repl.it/@thejan14/adventofcode2020) where I run the code using [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/).  
_Please note that I may exclude solutions for running on repl if they use C# 9.0 features as Mono only supports up to C# 7.0._
