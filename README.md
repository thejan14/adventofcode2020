# Advent of code 2020

Welcome to my advent of code 2020 contribution! The solutions are written in C# using .NET 5. When writing the solutions code I primarily aim for readability but try to always keep performance considerations in mind. Happy reading!

## Running the solutions
For running the code you need the [.NET 5.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) installed. Run the code via 
```
dotnet run
```

~~You can also have a look at my repl at [https://repl.it/@thejan14/adventofcode2020](https://repl.it/@thejan14/adventofcode2020) where I run the code using [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/).~~

#### Note about repl (16th of December)
*Unfortunately Mono doesn't support C# 9.0 yet, therefore day 16 won't compile in the repl. I may restructure the project so that only one solution at a time is run (also valuable as some solutions take a few seconds to compute) when I have time to spare. Until then you will have to compile on your local machine as described above.*
